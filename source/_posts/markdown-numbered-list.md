I've been using Markdown for quite some time, but this little trick never found a way to me, until now.

Instead of manually numbering list in Markdown

```md
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
```

You can use `1.` everywhere and it will increase next item automatically

```md
1. Item 1
1. Item 2
1. Item 3
```

Magic!
