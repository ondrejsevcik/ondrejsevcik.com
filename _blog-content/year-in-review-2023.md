I did start 2023 with no plans. This was intentional. I usually make big plans at the beginning of the year and then try to fulfill them during the year, but this time I wanted to try something else.

Sufficient to say, I did not like it. For most of the year, I wasn't sure what to focus on. I suppose I’m the kind of guy that likes to set goals and then keep chasing them.

## Fitness & Health

Since I moved away from hilly Innsbruck to Vienna, my workout routines have changed. Gone are the hours of trail running. Nowadays, I spend most of my workout time with triathlon-like sports (running, swimming, biking) on flat surfaces. I miss the hills.

In 2023, my top workout was surprisingly walking. Vienna is a huge city and very walkable. So with my partner, we spend a lot of time just exploring around. It wasn’t that unusual to go for a 4-hour walk to Ikea and back. And living next to Prater (one of the largest city parks in Europe) definitely contributed to that.

Some fitness stats from my Apple Watch

- 872 workouts
- 572 hours spent working out
- 1652km walking
- 2452km cycling
- 383km running
- 157km hiking
- 27h yoga
- 16km swimming
- 16h functional strength training

## **Reading**

I read a little bit less than I usually do in a year. I also dropped more books than usual and spent instead reading saved articles in my Readwise.

Books that I finished

1. [Sport je bolest](https://www.melvil.cz/kniha-sport-je-bolest/) (Sport is Pain)
2. [Debugging CSS](https://debuggingcss.com/)
3. [Průvodce pro pasivní investování](https://rozbiteprasatko.cz/produkt/pruvodce-pro-pasivni-investovani/) (Passive investment guide)
4. [Staff Engineers Path](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-staff-engineers/9781098118723/)
5. [Building a Second Brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/book) (my notes [here](https://ondrejsevcik.com/blog/building-a-second-brain))
6. [Spare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spare_(memoir)) (By Prince Harry)
7. [Klima je příležitost](https://klimajeprilezitost.cz/) (Climate is an opportunity)
8. [Ekonomické bubliny](https://www.grada.cz/ekonomicke-bubliny-10522/) (Economic bubbles)

## Listening

As usual, I spent a lot of time listening to podcasts. It’s my favorite way to fill out travel time.

Unfortunately, I don’t have any stats, since Apple Podcast’s app does not give me any. But in general, I listen to 1-2 podcasts per day (mostly 1-hour episodes).

## Writing

I managed to **write 9 articles** and make **1 book note**. In terms of writing, it’s been my best year. Given that I did not have any specific goals - I take it.

## Social Networks

Apart from blogging, I also spent some time on Mastodon. It’s been a refreshing year when it comes to social networks. Mastodon is quite a unique place with a very niche audience. And I like that. With **293 posts in a year**, I’ve been active there more than I ever was on Twitter.

## **Programming & Career**

This year was intense. **The AI managed to put everything upside down**. Lokalise had a second round of layoffs, but I was one of the lucky ones who survived. It’s been 2,5 years since I joined, and it feels like I worked at 5 different companies. I guess that’s normal when you join a startup?

Luckily enough, I also got the opportunity to work on a brand new UI experience. As a FE engineer, this was a dream come true.

I got to lead more projects, do more research, organize work for others, set clear goals, and think about strategy. It’s definitely one of the level-up moments in my career. I’m grateful for this opportunity.

## Other memorable experiences

One of the most memorable experiences of this year was my brother’s wedding. As a best man, I was put into a position to deliver a kick-ass **best man speech**. I usually don’t do much public speaking, but I could not say no to this once (hopefully) in a lifetime opportunity.

Another thing I will remember 2023 for, is that it's the year **I moved out of Austria**. After 7 years, I decided to make some changes. Why? Well, that would be for another blog post. Ping me if you're interested to hear more.

## Plans for 2024

My plans for the upcoming year are still in development. But I already know that I would like to keep writing, travel a bit more (nomad style), spend a bit more time indie hacking, and most importantly **just have fun**! 

Happy 2024 everyone!
