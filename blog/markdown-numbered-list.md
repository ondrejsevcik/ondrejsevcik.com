I've been using Markdown for quite some time, but this little trick never found a way to me, until now.

Instead of manually numbering list in Markdown, you can use `1.` everywhere and it will increase next item automatically.

```md
1. Item 1
1. Item 2
1. Item 3
```

will output

1. Item 1
1. Item 2
1. Item 3

Magic!
