In the last few years, I spent my time reading, listening, or watching some interesting content whenever possible. I was hungry to learn more and understand everything.

My mind was **constantly occupied**.

After reading several articles on this topic, I’ve realized that **I’m not spending any time on my own** - just me and my own thoughts.

The feed is surely interesting, but also infinite. I can never read it all. I need to learn how to do nothing again.

Since January, I stopped using Twitter, unsubscribed from most newsletters and [cleaned up my phone](https://medium.com/make-time/six-years-with-a-distraction-free-iphone-8cf5eb4f97e3) from distracting apps.

I don't automatically pick up the next podcast or audiobook whenever I have a moment. Instead, I try to enjoy and appreciate time just with my own thoughts.
