I’m an avid notetaker. Taking notes from various sources and then distilling them into something meaningful for me, is how I crystalize my thinking.

Building a Second Brain was a great fit for me. There were several great ideas that I’ve incorporated into my note-taking process.

> Your brain is for having ideas, not for holding them.

## PARA

PARA is a system for **organizing your notes for action**. Your notes should contribute to some outcome. Whatever doesn’t help you to make progress, **is probably distracting you**.

**Be picky about what you save**. If you’re not surprised, then you already knew it at some level. Avoid **confirmation bias** - saving what you already know.

Every piece of information you want to save can be placed into one of just four categories:

1. **Projects:** Short-term efforts in your work or life that you're working on now (Promotion, Redesign).
2. **Areas:** Long-term responsibilities you want to manage over time (e.g. Family, Health).
3. **Resources**: Topics or interests that may be useful in the future. This will fuel your upcoming projects.
4. **Archives**: Inactive items from the other three categories. Archiving notes out of sight is an important aspect of this system. The human mind needs a clean workspace to work most efficiently.

## Campsite Rule

> Leave the campsite better than you found it.

This rule is often quoted in programming, but it also fits perfectly for note-taking.

Every time you touch a note, **you should make it a little more discoverable for your future self**. Keep improving the note, every time you visit it. Add highlight, heading, some bullets, or a comment.

Bit by bit, I end up with a lot of great notes without too much effort at once.

Rewriting notes using your own language is also very useful. It’s known as a Generation Effect - **You’re more likely to remember information you’ve written in your own words**.

  you’re not gonna express the note in some way, why are you even capturing it?

## **Progressive Summarization**

Progressive summarization is a method of condensing information through multiple readings. It is a technique used for managing a large amount of information.

1. **Initial Capture**: The first step is to collect or capture the information from various sources. This could be in the form of notes, articles, books, videos, podcasts, etc.
2. **First Layer of Summarization**: Make bold the most important or striking points within the material. The goal is to quickly identify the parts that seem most useful or insightful.
3. **Second Layer**: This time, you highlight the parts of the bolded text that are even more significant. The purpose is to identify the essence of what's valuable in the content.
4. **Third Layer**: Create a summary in your own words or condense the highlighted and bolded sections into a shorter form.

## **The perfect system doesn’t exist**

The only way to know whether you’re getting the good stuff is to try putting it to use in real life. Don’t worry about whether you’re capturing “correctly.” **There’s no right way to do this, and therefore, no wrong way**.

**Any system that must be perfect to be reliable is deeply flawed**. You should prefer a system that is imperfect, but that continues to be useful in the real conditions of your life.
