## Heading level 2 - Lists and images

This is a paragraph before an _unnumbered_ list (`ul`). Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit, sed diam nonummy nibh euismod tincidunt ut laoreet dolore magna aliquam erat volutpat.

- One
- Two
- Three. Well, probably this list item should be longer. Note that for short items lists look better if they are compactly presented, whereas for long items, it would be better to have more vertical spacing between items.
- Four. This is the last item in this list. Let us terminate the list now without making any more fuss about it.
- Five

This is a paragraph before a _numbered_ list (`ol`). Note that the spacing between a paragraph and a list before or after that is hard to tune in a user style sheet. You can't guess which paragraphs are logically related to a list, e.g. as a "list header".

1. One
1. Two
1. Three. Well, probably this list item should be longer. Note that if items are short, lists look better if they are compactly presented, whereas for long items, it would be better to have more vertical spacing between items.
1. Four. This is the last item in this list. Let us terminate the list now without making any more fuss about it.
1. Five
