> Favor short words. 5×5×5×5 letters will fit nicely on a small screen. Focus on one idea per article, one argument per paragraph, one thought per sentence. A round argument starts with the main thought, exemplifies, expands, explains, closes and points to the next. Reorder your paragraphs until they hold hands.
