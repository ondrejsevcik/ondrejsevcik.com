This book is describing how sales changed from “door-to-door villain salesman” to contemporary sales, which is done by everyone, not just salespeople.

It was an easy read (4h) and I would recommend it to anyone who’s interested in sales or behavioral psychology.

## Book notes

- Almost half of your work time, you’re doing **non-sales selling**, which is just trying to move (influence) others.
- The line between sales and other departments is blurring.
  - Atlassian had $100+ million in revenues without a single salesman.
- **Sales is a service** helping people to make the best decision.
- Understand other’s people problems.
  - Problem finders people are far more valuable.
- **Being positive** makes buyers also positive and more likely to trust you and buy from you.
  - 3:1 ratio positivity to negativity.
- Help customers see their problems and solutions **more clearly**.
  - Don’t overwhelm buyers with options (**less is more**).
  - Emphasize the **experiences** they will gain (not just the material objects).
  - Focus on your **potential**.
- Give buyers a clear method of **action to take**.
- Modern pitches need to be **short and engaging** (must fit into Tweet).
- Use **improvisational theatre techniques** to improve your sales.
  - Your buyer's answers are "**offers**", not objections.
  - "Yes, and..." - agreeing and adding a suggestion.
- **Give real value** - You have to believe in the product you’re selling and that it makes customer's life better.
