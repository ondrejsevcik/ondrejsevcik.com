> Successful design systems move more slowly than the products they support. That’s a feature, not a bug. The slower pace doesn’t mean that design systems have to be a bottleneck to shipping product.

> Product can’t be expected to pause for the design system to catch up. If they need a feature that the design system does not yet (or may never) provide, the product team should move ahead and build the solution themselves.

> The job of the design system team is not to innovate, but to curate.
