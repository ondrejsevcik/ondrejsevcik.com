Great video explaining why long term success is achieved by cooperation and being nice.

> Be nice, forgiving, but don’t be a pushover!

- It pays to be Nice and Forgiving
- Be clear - If it is hard to figure out what’s going on, it is hard to build trust
- Tit for Tat is the winner strategy (long term games)
- If you opponent defects, strike back immediately.
- Most of life is not zero sum
- To win, you don’t need other to loose
