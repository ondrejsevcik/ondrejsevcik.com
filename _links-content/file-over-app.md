> File over app is a philosophy: if you want to create digital artifacts that last, they must be files you can control, in formats that are easy to retrieve and read. Use tools that give you this freedom.

> If you want your writing to still be readable on a computer from the 2060s or 2160s, itâ€™s important that your notes can be read on a computer from the 1960s.
